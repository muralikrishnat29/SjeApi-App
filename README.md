.Net Core API to retrive data from MongoDB

This is a primitive boiler plate for a .NET Core Web API with Docker that interacts with MongoDB and performs CRUD operations.

This API obtains data from the MongoDB database hosted by DBaaS providers like mLab, Azure, AWS,etc. This can be done by using the database settings in appsettings.json. For different databases, different connection detail sets.

Future Enhancements:
1. User authentication and authorisation module addition
2. Docker support for different runtimes
3. CORS support wherever required
